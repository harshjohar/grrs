# GRRS

This is a rust cli tool.

Clone of `grep`. Used to find line containg the given string in a file.

## Usage

```bash
grrs foo file.txt
```

## What i learnt.

- The output file will be for the platform where i run`cargo build`.
- To get for all platforms, use ci tool like `travis CI`, which is available in github OS projects for free, or some new service.
- Use that vm to generate all binaries.
- Read those docs again, some infor of mac, windows and linux are there.
